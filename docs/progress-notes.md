# Fashion Store Project Progress Notes

## Current Phase
Phase 2 – Product Management (Frontend + Backend)

## Completed
- Backend:
  - Product model created (name, description, price, imageUrl, category, countInStock)
  - Product CRUD API working (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Frontend:
  - Shop page fetches products from backend and displays in grid
  - “View Details” button navigates to Product Details page
  - Navbar updated:
    - Links: Home, Shop, Cart, Login, Register
    - Active link highlighting using `NavLink`
  - Routes added in `App.jsx`:
    - `/shop` → Shop page
    - `/product/:id` → Product Details page

## Notes
- All backend APIs tested and working in Postman
- Navigation fully functional; Shop link clickable and highlights when active
- ProductDetails page route added; frontend page ready but product fetching confirmed working
- Styling using Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps
Phase 3 – Authentication & Users
- Backend:
  - Create User model
  - Register & Login API with JWT + bcrypt
  - Protect routes (auth middleware)
- Frontend:
  - Login & Register pages
  - Conditional Navbar rendering (Login/Logout)
  - Connect frontend forms to backend APIs
- Later: Cart, Checkout, Orders

## Current Status
✅ Phase 2 backend + frontend integration complete
⏳ Phase 3 (Authentication) – not started
